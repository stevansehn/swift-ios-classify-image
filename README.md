# swift-ios-classify-image
This is an iOS application that uses a pre-trained Core ML model (SqueezeNet) to classify images selected from the photo library. Upon selecting an image, the model performs an image classification and displays the predicted label with its confidence score. The project uses SwiftUI for the UI and Vision framework for running Core ML requests.
